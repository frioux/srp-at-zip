# Scalability, Reliability, and Performance at ZipRecruiter

 Hi I'm fREW

---

# Agenda

 * Ask questions at any time; please remind me to repeat
 * General Terms
 * Strategies
 * Tactics
 * Specifically at ZR

---

# Quick Caveat

No right answers

> "You can prematurely optimize maintainability, flexibility, security &
> robustness just like you can performance." ‚Äî John Carmack

---

# Defining our Terms

---

## Scalability - Resource Saturation

   * Using 1% of all server resources but cannot get more servers

--

     * 100x
     * CPU, Memory, Disk, Bandwidth
     * turnkey systems
     * ‚âà performance

--

   * Using 100% of all server resources but can get unlimited servers

--

     * Could scale infinitely
     * (beware spherical chickens, measure everything)

--

   * Strategies ‚Üí Tactics

     * increase total resources ‚Üí more web workers
     * decrease usage ‚Üí stop being wasteful, use cperl

---

## Reliability - Error percentage

--

   * Strategies ‚Üí Tactics

     * Robustness to errors ‚Üí tests, timeouts, retries (IIS anecdote)
     * Be perfect ‚Üí (just kidding, bad advice)

---

## Performance - Maximum rate

--

   * 1k req per second
   * 30k queries per second

--

   * Strategies ‚Üí Tactics

     * Trade some perf for scalability ‚Üí eg MapReduce
     * Don't do it
     * Do it, but don't do it again
     * Do it less
     * Do it later
     * Do it when they're not looking
     * Do it concurrently
     * Do it cheaper
     * ([source](http://www.brendangregg.com/methodology.html))

## FYI...

Scalability required for business growth!

---

# @ ZipRecruiter

---

## Capacity Caches

 * 1 req/s; add cache; 1000 req/s
 * "NOW WE CAN SERVE 1000x THE USERS!"

--

 * ... time passes ...

--

 * ... cache gets blown ...

--

 * outage

--

 * more likely than above secenario because delta is less and growth is gradual

--

 * (hopefully) Balanced solution at Zip

   * Latency Caches (faster!) üëç
   * Capacity Caches (can even) üëé

--

 * ES example

---

## Timeouts / Reapers

 * "SendGrid is always fast!"

--

 * "DynamoDB is always fast!"

--

 * "S3 is always fast!"

--

 * EVERYTHING NEEDS A TIMEOUT

--

 * Reaper (+ MySQL) as a stopgap (h/t Hopkins)

## Aurora

 * CPU bound vs IO bound
 * Easily add read followers
 * MySQL on AWS had hard max IO not far above our avg use

--

 * Capacity Cache Lulz

---

## Aurora

<img src="./img/cpu1.png" >

---

## Aurora

<img src="./img/cpu2.png" >

---

## RWSplitter

 * "FreakyFriday" (h/t Cogg, Deltac)

<img src="./img/splitter.png" />

---

## Table Refactor

 * "quiz.description"
 * Log like data, etc

---

## Performance Monitoring

 * Graphite / Grafana

--

 * AccessLog

--

   * sql_count / sql_time

--

   * dynamodb_count / dynamodb_time

 * Helped reduce queries

--

---

## Memory Work

 * [Reaper now involved in memory
 usage](https://blog.afoolishmanifesto.com/posts/reap-slow-and-bloated-plack-workers/)
 * Iterate instead of pulling everything into memory
 * Not easy

---

## AccessLog in Action

<img src="./img/logsearch.png" width=800 />

---

## nginx vs Apache

 * Buffering vs Streaming
 * Huge win
 * Mobile (60%) Ransom

---

## Bakeoff

---
# What's Next @ ZipRecruiter?

 * Memory usage in perl is still very high
 * CPU usage is mysteriously high

---

# The End

 * Check out the SRE book by The Borg
